# Credit Risk Classification
## Analysis
* **Purpose of analysis:**
    * Overview of analysis
* **Explain financial information the data was on, and what is needed to predict:**
    * Financial data information
    * What we are trying to predict
* **Information about variables being predicted:** 
    * (e.g., `value_counts`).
* **Stages of machine learning process through conducted through analysis:**
    * Explaining machine learning process
* **Methods used:** 
    * (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms)

## Results
Describe **Accuracy**, **Precision** and **Recall** Scores of Machine Learning Models:
* **Machine Learning Model 1:**
    * **Accuracy:**
    * **Precision:**
    * **Recall:**

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
